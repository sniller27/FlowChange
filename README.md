# FlowChange
This is an older project made in Java.

The project was about making an drug-game application, where you can travel around as a drug dealer and buy drugs. 
Whenever you travel around as a drug dealer, the prices of the drugs change according to some specific price strategies.
When the game is done, a highscore list shows up with the top ranking players, which should be sorted their scores. The highscores are kept persistent by being stored in a textfile.

The application is also based on the BCE model(boundary-control-entity), which I think is familiar with MVC.
